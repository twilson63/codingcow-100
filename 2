How does the coding cow work?  It is 
simple, there are two commands: ./n (next) 
- ./r (reset)

During the lesson you will see a [cmd] 
then && ./n - this is a combo command to 
save you a step in the tutorial.  When you 
work on your own projects simply omit the 
'&& ./n'.  If you have more questions 
check out my FAQ -
